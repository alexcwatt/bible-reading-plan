# Five Day Bible Reading Plan

In 2024, I'm trying the [five day Bible reading plan](https://www.fivedaybiblereading.com/).

The website provides a free PDF with all the readings organized, but I don't want to use a printed piece of paper to track my readings. I prefer to use an app.

Since I use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) to organize my life in general, I put together a script to import my daily reading schedule into Todoist. This way, I can track my readings from my phone or computer.

## How to use

If you want to use this tool to create a project in your Todoist account that tracks your Bible reading, follow these steps:

- Get your [Todoist API token](https://todoist.com/help/articles/find-your-api-token-Jpzx9IIlB)
- Find the project ID that you want to add the tasks to (this is visible in the URL when browsing projects)
- Clone this repo
- `pip install -e .`
- `import`
